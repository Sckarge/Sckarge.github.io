This blog is an attempt to document my progress in my educational career. I am currently in my 3rd year of Btech in Computer Science from Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore. I am interested in all things technology, not just limited to my field of Computer Science, including, electronics, mechanics, manufacturing etc.  

I also have a desire to contribute to the cutting edge of datascience and machine learning and am currently working on a research paper on Multimodal Sarcasm detection, the process of which I will partially document here in the coming weeks and months. I am also looking at further oppurtunities to explore and contribute to this field of study.

I am programmer at heart so, I will leave you with some code
<!-- 
```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    cout<<"Hello world"<<endl;
    return 0;
}
``` -->
